This program is a simple application that is designed for one 
thing and one thing only: It senses the "Splash Screens" used
by Windows when you start up your computer, the computer is in
the process of shutting down, and when Windows prompts you "It
Is Now Safe To Turn Off Your Computer," or whatever you have 
it set to. This program allows you to copy those images to the 
clipoard, as well as "Refresh" them. If for no other reason, 
check this program out to learn what files Windows uses for 
the pictures behind the splash screens, and how to load pictures
into pictureboxs/images on runtime, a function that is VERY 
helpful when skinning. This could be useful for people attempting 
to make their own themes. By using the knowledge that I gained 
from this application, I wrote a program that changes those 
screens to some special files that I made.
P.S. Throw a vote in my direction if you can find the time: You
have no idea how long it took me poking around in my hard drive
to find these files, and to figure out how to load pictures on
runtime. And for those of you wondering how you load pictures
on runtime, this is the simplest code available.
Example: 
Private Sub Form_Load()
Picture1.Picture = LoadPicture("C:\Windows\Bubbles.bmp")
End Sub
